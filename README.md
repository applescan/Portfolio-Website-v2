## About me
### Hi there~! 
I'm Felicia. A Web Developer & UX Designer

As a Front-end Developer and UX Designer at Data insight, I bring a unique perspective to the development process. I have a solid foundation in programming languages, frameworks, and software architecture, as well as an understanding of human-centered design, including user research, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing. I have leveraged these skills to create intuitive and engaging user experiences that are both technically sound and scalable, making me a valuable asset to the team.
