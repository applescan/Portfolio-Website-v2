            Over the past three years, I've gotten my hands dirty with everything from crafting interfaces to squashing bugs and adding cool new features based on what users are asking for. 
            What I love doing is figuring out what users need and making it happen, coding it into reality. 
            I believe that understanding people is just as important as understanding code, and that‚Äôs what I bring to the table.
