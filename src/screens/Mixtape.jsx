        <p>Mixtape-me is an open-source app that allows you to make mixtapes of your top 5 tracks. All you need to do is
          login to Spotify and mixtape-me will sort your top tracks according to your listening history on your
          Spotify account. Share your mixtapes by saving the image!
          <br /><br />
          <b> How are the top tracks determined?</b>
          <br />
          Mixtape-me uses your listening history from your Spotify account. All the data is provided by Spotify.
          <br /><br />
          <b>How to save my mixtape?</b>
          <br />
          Click the download button on top of the mixtapes, wait for a little bit and the file should be
          downloaded to your device. Sometimes it takes multiple downloads for the image to load properly, so if your
          first image download doesn't turn out right, please redownload the image, or simply take a screenshot
          ðŸ“±
          <br /><br />
          <b>The app isn't working.</b>
          <br />
          If the app doesn't work, try clearing your cookies and site data for
          mixtape-me.herokuapp.com, or try a different device.

          The first thing I do is register my app 
          to the Spotify developer's account with the Spotify Web API Console,
          which lets you explore the endpoints with an easy-to-use interface.
          `}

        <br></br>

        <p>Based on simple REST principles, the Spotify Web API endpoints return JSON metadata about music artists,

        <p> There was a huge surge of users signing in and using Mixtape-me on the first day of its launch, and I will
          keep promoting the app to the public. The goal is to have 100 users on this project!

          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Involving users early in projects helps you understand real-world use cases, such as how people understand
          how to use the app and emerging technologies. It broadens your perspective and can lead you to discover
          creative ways of designing your product that makes it work better.
